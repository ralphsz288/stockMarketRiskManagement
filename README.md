The application is designed to assist investors in selecting appropriate companies by leveraging their historical financial data obtained through the Financial Modeling Prep API. Consequently, the application calculates a value based on specific financial data (DCF) and provides essential risk management indicators, including value at risk, beta, annualized volatility, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio.

Additionally, the app offers access to current news, press releases related to the respective companies, an 'insider trading' section, and a 'stock peers' section.
